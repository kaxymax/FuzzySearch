# FuzzySearch using RapidFuzz in Python
RapidFuzz is a fast string matching library for Python and C++, which is using the string similarity calculations from FuzzyWuzzy. It can handle millions of records, whereas, FuzzyWuzzy struggles with the records increases significantly.

Fuzzy search, simply put, allows for approximate matching rather than exact matching. Unlike traditional search methods, which require an exact match between the search query and the target data, fuzzy search algorithms employ advanced techniques to find matches even when there are discrepancies or variations in the data.
